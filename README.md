# SSH assets python library

This little utility allows configuring SSH keys to be loaded automatically to
the SSH agent based on asset configuration files, and can detect loaded keys
based on the key hash to avoid reloading existing keys.

## History

This module replaces previous module `systematic-ssh-config` when ready.
